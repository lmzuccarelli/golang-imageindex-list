  introduction: >-
    #### Quarkus is a Cloud Native, (Linux) Container First framework for
    writing Java applications.

    - **Container First:** Minimal footprint Java applications that are optimal for
    running in containers.

    - **Cloud Native:** Embraces 12 factor architecture in environments like
    Kubernetes.

    - **Unify imperative and reactive**: Brings under one programming model
    non-blocking and imperative styles of development.

    - **Standards-based**: Based on the standards and frameworks you love and
    use: RESTEasy and JAX-RS, Hibernate ORM and JPA, Netty, Eclipse Vert.x,
    Eclipse MicroProfile, Apache Camel.

    - **A great choice for microservices and serverless**: Brings lightning fast startup
    time and code turnaround to Java apps.

    - **Developer Joy**: Development centric experience bringing your amazing apps to life in no time.

        To view the build status of the Quarkus application:

        1. Hover over the icon on the bottom left quadrant of the
        **quarkus-quickstarts** deployment to see the build status in a
        tooltip.  

        1. Click the icon for quick access to the build log.  
        
            - You should be able
        to see the log stream of the **quarkus-quickstarts-1** build on the
        **Build Details** page. 
        
            - The application and its dependencies will be
        built into a container image and pushed to the OpenShift container
        registry.

        1. The icon on the bottom right quadrant of the **quarkus-quickstarts** deployment either represents the Git repository of the associated code, OR if the appropriate operators are installed, it will bring up the associated code in your IDE.
                  
        1. If the icon shown is Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab or generic Git, click it to navigate to the associate Git repository. Otherwise, if the icon shown is CodeReady Workspaces or Eclipse Che, click it to bring up the associated code in your IDE.

        Since a Java builder image was used during the **Import from Git** flow, a
        Java icon is used by default in Topology view.  
        
          - The displayed icon is determined by the
        value of the `app.openshift.io/runtime` label.
        
          - You can change the icon associated with a deployment to indicate its application type. 
          
          To associate a Quarkus icon with the **quarkus-quickstarts** deployment:
     

        1. Click on the **quarkus-quickstarts** deployment.

        1. In the side panel, click the **Actions** dropdown menu and select **Edit labels**.

        1. Click on the “x” next to the `app.openshift.io/runtime=java` label to
        remove it from the labels list.

        1. Add an additional label: 
          ```
          app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus
          ```

        1. Click on **Save** to save the labels.
