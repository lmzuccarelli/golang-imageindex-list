      description: |-
        To create a sample application:
        
        1. Click on the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}} at the top of the navigation, and select **Developer**.
        
        1. In the navigation menu, click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}.
       
        1. Using the project drop-down list, select the project you would like to create the sample application in. You can also create a new one if you’d like.
        
        1. Click **Samples** to create an application from a code sample.
        
        1. Click on the **Basic NodeJS** card.
        
        1. Scroll down and click **Create**.

        The **Topology** view will load with your new sample application. The application is represented by the light grey area with the white border. The deployment is a white circle.

          #### To verify the application was successfully created:
          1. Do you see a **sample-app** application?
          2. Do you see a **nodejs-basic** deployment?

        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: View build status
      description: |-
        ### To view the build status of the sample application:
        1. Hover over the icon on the bottom left quadrant of the **nodejs-basic** deployment to see the build status in a tooltip.
        2. Click on the icon for quick access to the build log.

        You should be able to see the log stream of the **nodejs-basic-1** build on the **Build Details** page.

        ### To view the associated code:
        1. In the navigation menu, click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.

        1. The icon on the bottom right quadrant of the **nodejs-basic** deployment either represents the Git repository of the associated code, OR if the appropriate operators are installed, it will bring up the associated code in your IDE.

        1. If the icon shown is Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab or generic Git, click it to navigate to the associate Git repository. Otherwise, if the icon shown is CodeReady Workspaces or Eclipse Che, click it to bring up the associated code in your IDE.
